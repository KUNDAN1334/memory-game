# Memory Game

This is a simple Memory Game built with React.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a grid of face-down cards.
2. Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its number.
3. Click on a second card to try and find a match.
4. If the two cards match, they will remain face-up.
5. If the cards don't match, they will flip back face-down after 3 seconds.
6. You can't flip more than two cards at a time.
7. During the 3-second delay for non-matching cards, you can't flip any other cards.
8. Continue flipping cards and finding matches until all pairs are found.
9. Once all cards are matched and face-up, you'll see a green "Completed!" message.

The goal is to find all matching pairs in the least number of moves and as quickly as possible. Good luck and have fun!
